    "### **MODELING**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will focus on building and evaluating predictive models for Remaining Useful Life (RUL):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We will first implement a **Linear Regression model** as a baseline.\n",
    "   * This will help us evaluate the impact of scaling and feature engineering on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * After establishing the baseline, we will model the data using more advanced algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **XGBoost**\n",
    "     * **NGBoost**\n",
    "     * **Decision Trees**\n",
    "   * These models are chosen for their ability to capture non-linear relationships and complex feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The performance of each model will be assessed using regression metrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "     * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "     * **RÂ² Score**\n",
    "   * This comparison will allow us to identify the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Once the best model is selected, we will perform **hyperparameter tuning** to further improve its predictive accuracy and generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In conclusion, the modeling phase will provide both a baseline and advanced approaches, enabling us to compare performance across different methods and identify the optimal model to predict RUL effectively.**\n",
